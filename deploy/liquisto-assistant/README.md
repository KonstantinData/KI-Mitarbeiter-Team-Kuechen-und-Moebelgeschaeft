# Liquisto Internal Assistant Deployment

This deployment target runs only the authenticated Liquisto assistant API for
text responses and internal WebRTC call brokering. It does not expose public
widget, WebSocket, upload, CRM-write, or tool routes.

The internal WebRTC session advertises exactly one provider function,
`open_liquisto_destination`. It carries only the semantic Navigation Contract
v1.1 documented in `docs/liquisto-assistant-runtime.md`; it is not an HTTP tool
route and cannot resolve URLs or mutate data.

## Boundary

- Entrypoint: `src.api.liquisto_assistant_main:app`
- Runtime service: `liquisto-local-assistant:8080`
- Local LLM service: `liquisto-assistant-llm:11434`
- Production provider base URL: exactly
  `http://liquisto-assistant-llm:11434/v1`
- Network: pre-created isolated Docker network `liquisto-assistant`
- Voice egress: dedicated `liquisto-voice-egress` bridge; host firewall should
  allow only required HTTPS provider traffic.
- Public host port: none

Create the isolated network once on the runtime host:

```bash
docker network create --internal liquisto-assistant
```

The SCAS backend and the local OpenAI-compatible provider must join that same
network. Do not attach this service to a public reverse proxy. When Voice is
enabled, restrict the egress network at the host firewall or egress proxy to
`api.openai.com:443`; it grants no inbound publication by itself.

## Required secrets and configuration

Provide these values through the deployment secret store, never repository
files or command history:

- `LIQUISTO_ASSISTANT_SERVICE_TOKEN`: shared SCAS-to-runtime Bearer token.
- `LIQUISTO_ASSISTANT_LLM_MODEL`: model identifier served by the local provider.
- `LIQUISTO_ASSISTANT_VOICE_ENABLED`: independent Voice kill switch; default false.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: required only when the internal Voice kill switch is enabled.

The compose file fixes `LIQUISTO_ASSISTANT_LLM_BASE_URL` to the only production
host accepted by runtime validation. `OPENAI_API_KEY` is used only by the
server-side internal Voice broker and is never returned to SCAS or the browser.

The production provider timeout is 60 seconds. This covers bounded Cockpit
requests on the approved CPU-only host, where prompt evaluation can exceed 20
seconds even while the local model is already resident. Provider failures still
fail closed and never activate a remote or cross-tenant fallback.

## Verification

Liveness is intentionally unauthenticated and contains no configuration:

```bash
curl --fail http://liquisto-local-assistant:8080/healthz
```

Expected exact body:

```json
{"status":"ok"}
```

Readiness is authenticated and verifies that the configured model is visible
on the local provider:

```bash
curl --fail \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LIQUISTO_ASSISTANT_SERVICE_TOKEN" \
  http://liquisto-local-assistant:8080/readyz
```

Expected exact body:

```json
{"contract_version":"2.0","status":"ready","tenant_id":"liquisto","agent_id":"liquisto-assistant"}
```

This repository change intentionally does not perform a live deployment.

Do not deploy the navigation slice until the SCAS counterpart is verified with
the same byte-exact v1.1 schema, DataChannel handling, authenticated principal
binding, CRM read-capability gate, local route allowlist, durable audit sink,
and joint allow/deny smoke tests. Keep the existing production version running
when any gate is missing or any contract field differs.

The SCAS runtime endpoint is exactly:

`http://liquisto-local-assistant:8080/assistant/respond`

The employee-authenticated SCAS BFF creates Olivia WebRTC calls through
`http://liquisto-local-assistant:8080/assistant/voice/calls`. Keep
`LIQUISTO_ASSISTANT_VOICE_ENABLED=false` until that BFF is deployed and set
`OPENAI_API_KEY` only in this server-side service environment. The public widget
must not call this endpoint and must never receive either secret.

When Voice is enabled, SCAS verifies the dedicated readiness contract:

```bash
curl --fail \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LIQUISTO_ASSISTANT_SERVICE_TOKEN" \
  http://liquisto-local-assistant:8080/assistant/voice/readyz
```

Expected exact body:

```json
{"contract_version":"2.0","status":"ready","tenant_id":"liquisto","agent_id":"liquisto-assistant","channel":"voice","voice_enabled":true,"navigation_contract_version":"1.1","navigation_destinations":["workbench.cockpit","crm.overview","crm.tasks"]}
```

This authenticated response is an exact release attestation. SCAS keeps Voice
navigation hidden when any key, value, or destination order differs.
